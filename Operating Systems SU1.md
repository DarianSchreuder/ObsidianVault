Know the different modes that programs have.
- User mode - Programs in this mode cannot access unauthorized data and hardware, they can only present requests to the kernel and the kernel will allocate the required resources. 
- Kernel mode - Kernel mode has full access to systems hardware and programs. Full control and management of file systems data and components.

For a user program to gain access to resources the program must create a system request that the kernel will evaluate and provide the needed resources if it is available.

### Primary Functions of an Operating System
- Provide a clean abstraction of System Resources to system users.
- Manage those resources in a safe and efficient way.
