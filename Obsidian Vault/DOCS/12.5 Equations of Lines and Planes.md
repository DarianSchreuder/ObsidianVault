### Lines

A line $L$ in three-dimensional space is determined when we know a point $P_0(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ on $L$ and a direction for $L$, which is conveniently described by a vector $\vec v$ parallel to the line. Let $P(x, y, z)$ be an arbitrary point on $L$ and let $r_0$ and $r$ be the position vectors of $P_0$ and $P$ (that is, they have representations $\vec {OP_0}$Â¸ and $\vec {OP}$). If $a$ is the vector with representation $\vec {P_0P}$, then the Triangle Law for vector addition gives $\vec r=\vec r_0+\vec a$.

Since $\vec a$ and $\vec v$ are parallel vectors, there is a scalar $t$ such that $a = t\vec v$.

$$ \vec r = \vec r_0 +t\vec v $$

which is a `vector equation` of $L$.

Each value of the `parameter` $t$ gives the position vector $\vec r$ of a point on $L$.

If the vector $\vec v$ that gives the direction of the line $L$ is written in component form as $\vec v = \langle a, b, c \rangle$, then we have $t \vec v = \langle ta, tb, tc \rangle$. We can also write $\vec r = \langle x, y, z\rangle$ and $\vec r_0 = \langle x_0, y_0, z_0 \rangle$, so the vector equation

$$ \langle x,y,z\rangle=\langle x_0 +ta,y_0+tb,z_0+tc \rangle $$

Parametric equations for a line through the point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ and parallel to the direction vector $\langle a,b,c \rangle$ are

$$ x=x_0+at \hspace{1cm} y = y_0 +bt \hspace{1cm} z=z_0 + ct $$

$$ \frac {x-x_0}{a} =\frac {y-y_0}{b} = \frac {z-z_0}{c} $$

These equations are called `symmetric equations` of $L$. Notice that the numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$ that appear in the denominators of Equations 3 are direction numbers of $L$, that is, components of a vector parallel to $L$. If one of $a$, $b$, or $c$ is $0$, we can still eliminate $t$. For instance, if $a=0$, we could write the equations of $L$ as

$$ x=x_0 \ \ \ \ \frac {y-y_0}{b} = \frac {z-z_0}{c} $$

The line segment from $r_0$ to $r_1$ is given by the vector equation

$$ \vec r(t)=(1-t)\vec r_0 +t\vec r_1 \ \ \ 0\le t \le 1 $$

### Planes

Thus a plane in space is determined by a point $P_0(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ in the plane and a vector $\vec n$ that is orthogonal to the plane. This orthogonal vector $\vec n$ is called a normal vector. Let $P(x, y, z)$ be an arbitrary point in the plane, and let $r_0$ and $r$ be the position vectors of $P_0$ and $P$. Then the vector $r-r_0$ is represented by $\vec {P_0P}$

$$ n\cdot(r-r_0)=0 \hspace{1 cm}n\cdot r=n\cdot r_0 $$

These equations are called the `vector equations of the plane`.

A `scalar equation of the plane` through point $P_0(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ with normal vector $\vec n = \langle a,b,c \rangle$ is

$$ a(x-x_0)+b(y-y_0)+c(z-z_o) = 0 $$

We create the linear equation of this by collecting the terms after multiplying out

$$ ax+by+cz+d=0 $$

### Distances

The distance $D$ from the point $P_1(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ to the plane $ax + by+cz+d=0$ is

$$ D=\frac {|ax_1+by_1+cz_1+d|}{\sqrt {a^2+b^2+c^2}} $$
