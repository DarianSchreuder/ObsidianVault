### Definition: subspace

A Subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is any subset $H$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ that has the following properties:

1.  $H$ contains the zero vector.
2.  For each $\vec u$ and $\vec v$ in $H$, the sum $\vec u + \vec v$ is also in $H$. (We say $H$ is closed under addition.)
3.  For each $\vec u$ in $H$ and each scalar $c$, the vector $c\vec u$ is also in $H$. (We say $H$ is closed under scalar multiplication.)

### The span of vectors

Let $\vec v_1,\vec v_2,\dots,\vec v_p$ be vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and

$$ H=Span\{\vec v_1,\vec v_2,\dots,\vec v_p\} $$

Then $H$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$. It is called the subspace spanned (or generated) by $\vec v_1,\vec v_2,\dots,\vec v_p$.

proof:

### The zero subspace

The subset consisting of only the zero vector in any $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

NB: The zero subspace of any vector space and the null space of a matrix (to be defined shortly) are two totally different concepts.

### The column space

The column space of a matrix $A$ is the set $Col~A$ consisting of all linear combinations of the columns of $A$, `i.e.` the column space is the span of the column of $A$. If $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix, then the column space is therefore of subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

### The null space

The null space of a matrix $A$ is the set $Nul~A$ of all solutions of the homogenous equation $A\vec x=\vec 0$

### Theorem 12

The null space of an $m\times n$ matrix $A$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Said differently: The set of all solutions of a system $A\vec x=\vec 0$ of $m$ homogeneous linear equations in $n$ unknowns is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

### Definition: Basis

A basis $\vec B$ for a subspace $H$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a subset of such that

1.  $\vec B$ is a linearly independent set in $H$ and
2.  $\vec B$ spans $H$.

### Algorithm to find null space of $A$

1.  Write the matrix equation $A\vec x=\vec 0$ in the augmented matrix from $\begin{bmatrix}A &|& \vec 0\end{bmatrix}$ and transform to reduced echelon form.
2.  Identify the free variables and write the general solution in parametric vector form.
3.  The vectors that spans the solution set are the generators of the null space and will, by the construction, always be linearly independent and thus a basis for the null space.

### A basis for the column space

### Theorem 13

The pivot columns of a matrix $A$ form a basis for the column space of $A$.

Warning:

Take the pivot positions of $A$ itself, `not` of the matrix in echelon form that is the equivalent to $A$.

### Algorithm for the basis of column space of $A$

-   Transform matrix $A$ to reduced row echelon from $B$.
-   Identify the columns with the pivots in $B$.
-   Return of the matrix $A$ itself and take only the pivot columns of $A$ (`i.e.` those that correspond to the pivot columns of $B$). These columns form a basis for the column space of $A$.
