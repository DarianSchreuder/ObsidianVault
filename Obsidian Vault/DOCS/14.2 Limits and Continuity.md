### Limits of Functions of Two Variables

The limit of a function of two variables, `f(x,y)`, as `(x,y)` approaches a given point `(a,b)`, is the value that `f(x,y)` approaches as `(x,y)` gets arbitrarily close to `(a,b)`. If the limit exists and is equal for all paths of approach, then the function is said to be continuous at the point `(a,b)`. If the limit does not exist or is not equal for all paths of approach, then the function is not continuous at the point `(a,b)`. To evaluate the limit, we approach `(a,b)` along a variety of paths and check if the function approaches the same value along each path. If it does, then the limit exists and is equal to the common value; if not, then the limit does not exist.

### Definition {Formail $\epsilon-\delta$}
Let $f$ be a function of two variables whose domain $\mathbb{D}$ includes points arbitrarily close to $(a,b)$. Then we say that the limit of $f(x,y)$ as $(x,y)$ approaches $(a,b)$ is $L$ and we write $$\lim_{(x,y)\rightarrow (a,b)}f(x,y)=L$$if for every $\epsilon > 0$ there is a corresponding number $\delta > 0$ such that if $(x,y)\in\mathbb{D}$ and $0 < \sqrt{(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2}<\delta$ then $|f(x,y)-L|<\epsilon$

### Showing that a Limit Does Not Exist

Multivariable functions can be approached from an infinite number of directions so to prove that a limit does no exist you need to prove that there are unequal limits.

If $f(x,y)\rightarrow L_1$ as $(x,y) \rightarrow (a,b)$ along a path $C_1$ and $f(x,y) \rightarrow L_2$ as $(x,y)\rightarrow (a,b)$ long a path $C_2$ where $L_1 \neq L_2$, then $\lim_{(x,y)\rightarrow (a,b)}f(x,y)$ does not exist.

### Properties of Limits

The properties of limits are as follows:

1.  **The limit of a sum is the sum of the limits**. If `f(x)` and `g(x)` have limits as `x` approaches `a`, then the limit of their sum, `f(x) + g(x)`, as `x` approaches `a` is the sum of their limits:

```
lim (f(x) + g(x)) = lim f(x) + lim g(x)
x → a              x → a          x → a

```

1.  **The limit of a product is the product of the limits**. If `f(x)` and `g(x)` have limits as `x` approaches `a`, then the limit of their product, `f(x)g(x)`, as `x` approaches `a` is the product of their limits:

```
lim (f(x)g(x)) = lim f(x) * lim g(x)
x → a           x → a          x → a

```

1.  **The limit of a quotient is the quotient of the limits, provided the limit of the denominator is not zero**. If `f(x)` and `g(x)` have limits as `x` approaches `a`, and `lim g(x)` is not equal to zero, then the limit of their quotient, `f(x)/g(x)`, as `x` approaches `a` is the quotient of their limits:

```
lim f(x)     lim g(x)
--------- = ---------
x → a   g(x) → a   g(x)

```

1.  **The limit of a constant times a function is the constant times the limit of the function**. If `f(x)` has a limit as `x` approaches `a`, then for any constant `c`, the limit of `cf(x)` as `x` approaches `a` is `c` times the limit of `f(x)` as `x` approaches `a`:

```
lim cf(x) = c lim f(x)
x → a     x → a

```

1.  **The limit of a composite function is the composite of the limits**. If `g(x)` has a limit as `x` approaches `a`, and `f(x)` has a limit as `x` approaches `g(a)`, then the composite function `f(g(x))` has a limit as `x` approaches `a`, and the limit is the composite of the two limits:

```
lim f(g(x)) = f(lim g(x))
x → a       x → a

```

### Continuity

Continuity is a property of functions that describes how they behave around a given point. A function is said to be continuous at a point if the limit of the function as the input approaches that point is equal to the value of the function at that point. In other words, a function is continuous at a point if there are no sudden jumps or discontinuities in its behavior at that point. If a function is not continuous at a point, it may have a hole in its graph, a vertical asymptote, or a jump discontinuity. Understanding continuity is important in the study of calculus because it allows us to make certain predictions about the behavior of functions and to perform certain calculations with confidence.

## Definition
A function $f$ of two variables called `continuous at` $(a,b)$ if $$\lim_{(x,y)\rightarrow (a,b)}f(x,y)=f(a,b)$$We say that $f$ is `is continuous on` $\mathbb{D}$ if $f$ is continuous at every point $(a,b)$ in $\mathbb{D}$.
