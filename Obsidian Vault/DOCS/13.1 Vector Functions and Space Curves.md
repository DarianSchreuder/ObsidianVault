Vector functions are mathematical functions that operate on vectors. In other words, they take in vectors as input and output another vector. These functions are widely used in many fields, such as physics, engineering, and computer science.

There are several types of vector functions, including scalar multiplication, addition, subtraction, dot product, cross product, and normalization. Scalar multiplication involves multiplying a vector by a scalar, which is a single number. Addition and subtraction are straightforward operations that involve adding or subtracting vectors component-wise.

The dot product is a scalar that represents the projection of one vector onto another. It is calculated by multiplying the corresponding components of the two vectors and adding them up. The cross product is a vector that is perpendicular to both of the input vectors. It is calculated by taking the determinant of a 3x3 matrix that is formed by the input vectors.

Normalization is the process of converting a vector into a unit vector, which has a magnitude of 1. This is done by dividing each component of the vector by its magnitude.

In conclusion, vector functions are powerful tools that are used to manipulate vectors in many different ways. Understanding these functions is essential for anyone working with vectors in any field.

Vector-valued functions are mathematical functions that output vectors based on an input parameter, such as time. They are often used to describe the motion of objects in physics, such as the trajectory of a projectile. In essence, they map a one-dimensional input to a multi-dimensional output. One example of a vector-valued function is the position function, which describes the position of an object in space as a function of time.

### Vector-valued Functions

In general, a function is a rule that assigns to each element in the domain an element in the range. A `vector-valued function`, or `vector function`, is simply a function whose domain is a set of real numbers and whose range is a set of vectors. We are most interested in vector functions $\vec r$ whose values are three-dimensional vectors. This means that for every number $t$ in the domain of $\vec r$ there is a unique vector in $V_3$ denoted by $\vec r(t)$. If $f(t)$, $g(t)$, and $h(t)$ are the components of the vector $\vec r(t)$, then $f$ , $g$, and $h$ are real-valued functions called the `component functions` of $r$ and we can write

$$ \vec r(t)=\langle f(t),g(t),h(t)\rangle=f(t)i+g(t)j+h(t)k $$

### Limits and continuity

The `limit` of a vector function `r` is defined by taking the limits of its component functions as follows:

If $\vec r(t)=\langle f(t), g(t),h(t)\rangle$, then

$$ \lim_{t\Rightarrow a}\vec r(t)=\langle \lim_{t\Rightarrow a}f(t),\lim_{t\Rightarrow a}g(t),\lim_{t\Rightarrow a}h(t)\rangle $$

provided the limits of the component functions exist.

### Space Curves

There is a close connection between continuous vector functions and space curves. Suppose that $f$ , $g$, and $h$ are continuous real-valued functions on an interval $I$. Then the set $C$ of all points $(x, y, z)$ in space, where

$$ x = f(t) \ \ \ \ y = t(t)\ \ \ \ z = h(t) $$

and $t$ varies throughout the interval $I$, is called a `space curve`. The equations in (2) are called `parametric equations of $C$` and $t$ is called a `parameter`. We can think of $C$ as being traced out by a moving particle whose position at time $t$ is $( f(t), t(t), h(t))$. If we now consider the vector function $\vec r(t) = \langle f(t), g(t), h(t)\rangle$, then $\vec r(t)$ is the position vector of the point $P( f(t), t(t), h(t))$ on $C$. Thus any continuous vector function $\vec r$ defines a space curve $C$ that is traced out by the tip of the moving vector $\vec r(t)$, as shown in Figure 1.
