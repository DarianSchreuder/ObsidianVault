**Theorem 3:**
Let $A$ be a square matrix.
1. If a multiple of one row of $A$ is added to another row to produce a matrix $B$, then $\det(B)=\det(A)$
2. If two rows of $A$ are interchanged to produce $B$, then $\det(B)=-\det(A)$.
3. if one row of $A$ is multiplied by $k$ to produce $B$, then $\det(B)=k\det(A)$.

### Relation: det(A) and det of its equivalent row echelon form U (if no scaling took place)
- When $A$ is invertible, $\det(A)=(-1)^T$.(product of pivots in U), where $r$ is the number of interchanges of rows made in the reduction of $A$ to $U$;
- When $A$ is not invertible, then $\det(A)=0$.

---
**Theorem 4:**
A square matrix is invertable if and only if $\det(A)\neq 0$.

---
**Theorem 5:**
If $A$ is an $n\times n$ matrix, then $\det(A)=\det(A^t)$.

---
**Theorem 6:**
Multiplicative property:
If $A$ and $B$ are $n\times n$ matrices, then
$$
\det(AB) = (\det(A)
)(\det(B))
$$

---
**Remember:**
- $\det(A^n)=(\det(A))^n$
- $\det(A + B) \neq \det(A) + \det(B)$
- $\det(A-B)\neq\det(A)-\det(B)$
