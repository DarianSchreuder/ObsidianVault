If $f$ is continuous on a polar rectangle R given by $0\le a\le r\le b$ and $\alpha\le\theta\le\beta$, where $0\le\beta-\alpha\le2\pi$, then
$$
\large
\iint_\mathbb{R}f(x,y)dA=\int^\beta_\alpha\int^b_af(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta)rdrd\theta
$$

**More general Polar Reagions**
We move on from polar rectangles to more general polar regions. We look at regions where $\theta$ still lies between two constants, but $r$ now lies between two polar curves $h_1(\theta)$ and $h_2(\theta)$.
$$
\large
\iint_\mathbb{R}f(x,y)dA=\int^\beta_\alpha\int^{h_2(\theta)}_{h_1(\theta)}f(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta)rdrd\theta
$$
