### Vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$

A matrix with only one column is called a `column vector`, or simply a `vector`.

Two vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$ are `equal` if and only if their corresponding entries are equal.

Given two vectors $\vec u$ and $\vec v$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, their sum is the vector $\vec u + \vec v$ by adding corresponding entries of $\vec u$ and $\vec v$.

### Vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$

If n is a positive integer, $\mathbb{R}^n$ (read “r-n”) denotes the collection of all lists (or ordered n-tuples) of n real numbers, usually written as n 1 column matrices, such as

$$ \vec u = \begin{bmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ \downarrow \\ u_n\end{bmatrix} $$

The vector whose entries are all zero is called the `zero vector` and is denoted by $\vec 0$.

### Linear Combinations

Given vectors $\vec v_1,\vec v_2,\dots,\vec v_p$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and given scalars $c_1, c_2,\dots, c_p$ the vector $y$ defined by

$y = c_1\vec v_1 + ... + c_p\vec v_p$

is called a `linear combination` of $\vec v_1,\dots,\vec v_p$ with `weights` $c_1,\dots,c_p$ .

A vector equation

$$ x_1\vec a_1+x_2 \vec a_2+...+x_n\vec a_n=\vec b $$

has the same `solution set` as the linear system whose augmented matrix is

$$ \begin{bmatrix}\vec a_1&\vec a_2&...&\vec a_n&\vec b\end{bmatrix} $$

In particular, $b$ can be generated by linear combination of $\vec a_1,...,\vec a_n$ if and only if there exists a `solution` to the linear system corresponding to the matrix.

### Definition

If $\vec v_1,...,\vec v_p$ are in $\mathbb{R}^n$, then the set of all linear combinations of $\vec v_1,...,\vec v_p$ is denoted by $Span\{\vec v_1,...,\vec v_p\}$ and is called the subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ spanned (or `generated`) by $\vec v_1,\dots, \vec v_p$. That is, $Span\{\vec v_1,...,\vec v_p\}$ is the collection of all vectors that can be written in the form

$$ c_1\vec v_1+c_2\vec v_2+...+c_n\vec v_n $$

with $c_1,...,c_p$ scalars,

### A geometric description of Span{$\vec v$} and Span{$\vec u,\vec v$}

Let $\vec v$ be a nonzero vector in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The Span{$\vec v$} is the set of all scalar multiples of $\vec v$, which is the set of points on the line in $\mathbb{R}^3$ through $\vec v$ and $\vec 0$.

If $\vec u$ and $\vec v$ are nonzero vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$, with $\vec v$ not a multiple of $\vec u$, then Span{$\vec u$,$\vec v$} is the plane in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that contains $\vec u$,$\vec v$ and $\vec 0$. In particular, Span{$\vec u$,$\vec v$} contains the line in $\mathbb{R}^3$ through $\vec u$ and $\vec 0$ and the line through $\vec v$ and $\vec 0$.
