### Homogeneous Linear Systems
A linear system of equations are called `homogeneous` if it can be written in the form$$A\vec x=\vec 0$$where $A$ is a $m\times n$ matrix and $\vec 0\in \mathbb{R}^m$.

The homogeneous system $A\vec x = \vec 0$ has a nontrivial solution if and only if the equation has at least one free variable.
However a homogeneous system will always have atleast one solution, the `trivial solution`  $\vec x = 0$  .

### Parametric Vector Form
The solution set to the linear system is written in the form:$$\vec x = s\vec u + t\vec v, \hspace{1 cm}s,t\in\mathbb{R}$$
### Solutions of non-homogeneous systems
A non-homogeneous system of linear equations is of the form $$A\vec x=\vec b, \hspace{0.5 cm}with\space  \vec b\neq \vec 0.$$
If infinitely many solutions exist for a non-homogeneous system, then the general solution can be written in parametric vector form as a constant vector and a linear combination of the vectors that satisfies the homogeneous system $A\vec x = \vec 0$.

### Parametric Vector Equations for a **Consistent System**

1.  Transform augmented matrix to reduced echelon form.
2.  Express each basic variable in terms of free variables.
3.  Write solution $\vec x$ as vector in terms of free variables.
4.  Decompose $\vec x$ as a linear combination of vectors with constants separately and each free variable separately

#### Theorem 6
Suppose the system $A\vec x = \vec b$ is consistent for some given $\vec b$, and let $\vec p$ be a solution. Then the solution set of $A\vec x = \vec b$ is the set of all vectors of the form $\vec w = \vec p + \vec v_h$ , where $v_h$ is any solution of the homogeneous equation $A\vec x = \vec 0$.
