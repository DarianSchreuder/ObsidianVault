**Invertible matrix theorem(continued)**
Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ matrix. Then $A$ is invertible if and only if:
12. The number $0$ is not an eigenvalue of $A$.
13. The determinant of $A$ is not zero.

**Theorem 3:**
Let $A$ and $B$ be $n\times n$ matrices.
1. $A$ is invertible if and only if $\det A \neq 0$.
2. $\det AB = (\det A)(\det B)$.
3. $\det A^T=\det A$.
4. If $A$ is triangular, then $\det A$ is the product of the entries on the mail diagonal of $A$.
5. A row replacement operation on $A$ does not change the determinant. A row interchange changes the sign of the determinant. A row scaling also scales the determinant by the same factor.

**The Characteristic Equation**
We define the `characteristic equation` for an $n\times n$ matrix $A$ as the scalar equation
$$
\det (A-\lambda I)=0
$$
A scalar $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue if and only if it is a solution of the characteristic equation.

**The characteristic polynomial and algebraic multiplicity**
The polynomial $\det (A-\lambda I)$ is called the characteristic polynomial and the number if time a factor $(\lambda-q)$ appears in the factorization of characteristic polynomial, is called algebraic multiplicity of the eigenvalue $\lambda=q$.

---
**Geometric multiplicity**
The geometric multiplicity of an eigenvalue $\lambda$ of a matrix $A$ is defined as the dimension of the eigenspace corresponding to $\lambda$.

---
**Similarity:**
Let $A$ and $B$ be $n × n$ matrices. We say $A$ is similar to $B$ if there exists an invertible matrix $P$ such that $P^−1AP = B$, or, equivalently, $A = PBP^−1$.
**Remark:**
If $A$ is similar to $B$ 𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ $P^−1PA = B$ 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑤𝑒 𝑤𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒 $Q = P^−1$ , then we get $QAQ^−1 = B$, that is, $B$ is similar to $A$. Therefore we simply say $A$ and $B$ are similar.

---
**Theorem 4:**
If the $n × n$ matrices $A$ and $B$ are similar, then they have the same characteristic polynomial and hence the same eigenvalues (with the same algebraic multiplicities).
