### Definition: Coordinate Vector

Suppose the set

$$ B=\{b_1,b_2,...,b_p\} $$

is a basis for the subspace $H.$

If $\vec x \in H$, we can write $\vec x$ in the form $\vec x = c_1b_1+...+ c_pb_p$, with $c_1,..,c_p \in \mathbb{R}$.

The vector in $‚Ñù^ùëù$ with coordinates the weights $ùëê_1, ‚Ä¶ , ùëê_ùëù$, is called the `coordinate vector` of $\vec x$ (relative to $B$) or the $B$-coordinate vector of $\vec x$ relative to the basis $B$ and is denoted by $[x]_B$, i.e.

$$ [x]_B=\begin{bmatrix} c_1 \\ c_2\\:\\c_p \end{bmatrix} $$

### Definition

-   The dimension of a nonzero subspace $H$, denoted by dim $H$, is the number of vectors in any basis for the $H$. The dimension of the zero subspace$\{\vec 0\}$ is defined to be zero.
-   The rank of a matrix $A$, denoted by rank $A$, is the dimension of the columns space of $A$.

### Theorem 14

If a matrix $A$ has $n$ columns, then rank $A+$ dim $Nul~A=n$.

Note: the dimension of $A$ is also called null

### Theorem 15

Let $H$ be an $p$-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Any linearly independent set of exactly $p$ elements in $H$ is automatically a basis for $H$. Also, any set of $p$ elements of $H$ that spans $H$ is automatically a basis for $H$.

### Theorem 8 (continued)

1.  The columns of $A$ form a basis of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
2.  $Col~A=\mathbb{R}^n$
3.  dim $Col~A=n$
4.  rank $A=n$.
5.  $Nul~A=\{\vec 0\}$.
6.  dim $Nul~A=0$.
