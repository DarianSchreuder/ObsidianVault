### Definitions and geometry of transformations

A `transformation` (or function or mapping) 𝑇 from $ℝ^𝑛$ to $ℝ^𝑚$ is a rule that assigns to each vector 𝒙 in $ℝ^n$ a vector 𝑇(𝒙) in $ℝ^𝑚$ . The set $ℝ^𝑛$ is called the `domain` and $ℝ^𝑚$ the `codomain`. For 𝒙 in $ℝ^𝑛$, 𝑇(𝒙) in $ℝ^𝑚$ is called the `image` of 𝒙 (under action of 𝑇). The set of all images 𝑇(𝒙) is called the `range` of 𝑇.

A `matrix transformation` is a transformation 𝑇: $ℝ^𝑛$ → $ℝ^𝑚$ with $𝑇(\vec x) = A\vec x$, where $𝐴$ is an $𝑚 × 𝑛$ matrix.

### Linear Transformations

A transformation is linear if

1.  $𝑇(\vec 𝒖 + \vec 𝒗) = 𝑇(\vec 𝒖) + 𝑇(\vec 𝒗)$

for all $\vec 𝒖,\vec 𝒗$ in the domain of 𝑇. 

2. $𝑇(𝑐\vec 𝒖) = 𝑐𝑇(\vec 𝒖)$
for all scalars $𝑐$ and all $\vec 𝒖$ in the domain of $T$.

### Geometry
-   A shear transformation 𝑇: $ℝ^2$ → $ℝ^2$ with $T(\vec x) = A\vec x$ maps a square to a parallelogram.
-   A contraction 𝑇: $ℝ^2$ → $ℝ^2$ with $T (\vec x) = 𝑟\vec x (0 ≤ 𝑟 ≤ 1)$ scales a figure down by a factor of $𝑟$.
-   A dilation (or dilatation) 𝑇: $ℝ^2$ → $ℝ^2$ with 𝑇(𝒙) = 𝑟𝒙 (𝑟 > 1) scales a figure up by a factor of $𝑟$.
-   A rotation is a transformation 𝑇: $ℝ^2$ → $ℝ^2$ which-rotates any vector (or figure) counter-clockwise by a certain angle.
