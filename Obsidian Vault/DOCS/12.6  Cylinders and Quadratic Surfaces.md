### Cylinders

A cylinder is a surface that consists of all lines (called rulings) that are parallel to a given line and pass through a given plane curve.

### Quadratic Surfaces

A quadric surface is the graph of a second-degree equation in three variables $(x,y,z)$. The most general such equation is

$$ Ax^2 + By^2 + Cz^2 + Dxy + Eyz + Fxz + Gx + Hy + Iz + J = 0 $$

where A, B, C, . . . , J are constants, but by translation and rotation it can be brought into one of the two standard forms

$$ Ax^2 + By^2 + Cz^2 + J = 0\\ or \\Ax^2 + By^2 + Iz = 0 $$
