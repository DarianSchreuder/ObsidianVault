**Eigenvectors and eigenvalues**
An eigenvector of an $n Ã— n$ matrix $A$ is a nonzero vector $x$ such that $Ax = \lambda x$ for some scalar $\lambda$. A scalar $\lambda$ is called an eigenvalue of $A$ if there is a nontrivial solution $x$ for $Ax = \lambda x$; such an $x$ is called an eigenvector of $A$ corresponding to $\lambda$.

**Theorem 1:**
The eigenvalues of a triangular matrix are the entries on its main diagonal.

---
**Theorem 2:**
If $\vec v_1, \vec v_2,\dots, \vec v_r$ are eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues $\lambda_1, \lambda_2,\dots, \lambda_r$, then the set $\{\vec v_1, \vec v_2,\dots , \vec v_r\}$ is linearly independent.
