Consider a surface $z=f(x,y)$ and f have continuous first partial derivatives, at a point $P(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ on the surface. The surface has a plane tangent to the surface at the point  $P(x_0,y_0,z_0)$. If we are close enough to $P(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ , the surface $z=f(x,y)$ can be approximated by the tangent plane.
### Equation of a tangent plain

The equation of the tangent plane is:

$$ f_x(x_0,y_0)(x−x_0)+f_y(x_0,y_0)(y−y_0)=z−z_0 $$

### The linear approximation of the surface

Let $f$ be a function of two variables with $(a,b)$ $\in$ Domain($f$) and $f_x$ and $f_y$ continuous at $(a,b)$. Then the linearization of $f$ at $(a,b)$ is the function $$ f(x,y)≈L(x,y)=z_0+f_x(x_0,y_0)(x−x_0)+f_y(x_0,y_0)(y−y_0) $$
### Definition 

---
If $z=f(x, y)$, then $f$ is differentiable at $(a, b)$ if $\Delta z$ can be expressed in the form
$$
\Delta z=f_x(a, b) \Delta x+f_y(a, b) \Delta y+\varepsilon_1 \Delta x+\varepsilon_2 \Delta y
$$
where $\varepsilon_1$ and $\varepsilon_2$ are functions of $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$ such that $\varepsilon_1$ and $\varepsilon_2 \rightarrow 0$ as $(\Delta x, \Delta y) \rightarrow(0,0)$
Definition 7 says that a differentiable function is one for which the linear approxin ion (4) is a good approximation when $(x, y)$ is near $(a, b)$. In other words, the tange lane approximates the graph of $f$ well near the point of tangency.
It's sometimes hard to use Definition 7 directly to check the differentiability of a fur ion, but the next theorem provides a convenient sufficient condition for differentiabili

### Theorem
If the partial derivatives $f_x$ and $f_y$ exist near $(a, b)$ and are continuous at $(a, b)$, then $f$ is differentiable at $(a, b)$.

### The total differential:

$$ dz=f_x(x,y)dx+f_y(x,y)dy= \frac{\partial z}{\partial x}dx +\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}dy $$
