**(Complex) Eigenvalue and Eigenvector**
- A complex scalar $\lambda$ is called a (complex) eigenvalue of a real matrix $A$ if there is a nonzero vector $x$ in $\mathbb{C}^n$ such that $A \vec x = \lambda \vec x$. The vector $x$ is called a complex eigenvector corresponding to $\lambda$.
- As in the real case, $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue if and only if
$$
\large \det(A-\lambda I)=0
$$
**Revision: Complex numbers**
- • If $z = a + ib$ is a complex number, $a$ is called the real part of $z$ and $b$ the imaginary part of $z$. We write $ℛe(z) = a$ and $ℑm(z) = b$.
- If $z = a + ib$ is a complex number, then the number $a-ib$ is called the complex conjugate of $a + ib$ and is denoted by $\vec z$.

**Conjugates, real and imaginary parts of vectors and matrices**
If $x$ is a vector in $\mathbb{C}^n$, then the conjugate vector 𝒙ഥ is the vector in ℂ 𝑛 whose entries are the complex conjugates of the entries in 𝒙. The real and complex parts of a complex vextor 𝒙 are the vectors 𝑅𝑒(𝒙) and 𝐼𝑚 𝒙 formed from the real and imaginary parts of the entries of 𝒙.
