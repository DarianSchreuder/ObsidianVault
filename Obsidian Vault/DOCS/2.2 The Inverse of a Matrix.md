### Definition

An $𝑛 × 𝑛$ matrix $𝐴$ is said to be `invertible (or nonsingular)` if there exists an $𝑛 × 𝑛$ matrix $𝐶$ such that

$$ CA=I=AC $$

We call $𝐶$ an `inverse` of $𝐴$. Since a matrix’s inverse is `unique` (if it exists), we denote it by $𝐴^{−1}$.

### Theorem 4

Let $A = \begin{bmatrix}a &b\\c&d\end{bmatrix}$. If $ad-bc \neq 0$ then $A$ is `invertible` and

$$ A^{-1}=\frac{1}{ad-bc}\begin{bmatrix}d&-b\\-c&a\end{bmatrix} $$

-   If $ad-bc=0$, then $A$ is `not invertible`.
-   The number $𝑎𝑑 − 𝑏𝑐$ is called the `determinant` of $𝐴$ and we write

$$ det(A)=ad-bc $$

### Theorem 5

If $A$ is an invertible $𝑛 × 𝑛$ matrix, then the equation $A\vec x = \vec b$ has the unique solution $\vec x = A^{-1}\vec b$ for each $\vec b$ in $ℝ^n$

### Theorem 6

-   If $𝐴$ is an invertible matrix, then $𝐴^{−1}$ is invertible and $(A^{-1})^{-1}=A$.
-   If $𝐴$ and $𝐵$ are $𝑛 × 𝑛$ invertible matrices, then so is $𝐴𝐵$, and the inverse of 𝐴𝐵 is the product of the inverses of $𝐴$ and $𝐵$ in the reverse order. That is, $(AB)^{-1}=B^{-1}A^{-1}$
-   If $A$ is an invertible matrix, then so is $𝐴^𝑇$, and the inverse of $𝐴^𝑇$ is the transpose of $𝐴^{−1}$. That is, $(A^T)^{-1}=(A^{-1})^{T}$

### Definition

An `elementary matrix` is one that is obtained by performing a single elementary row operation on an identity matrix

### Theorem 7

An $𝑛 \times 𝑛$ matrix $𝐴$ is invertible if and only if $𝐴$ is row equivalent to $𝐼_𝑛$, and in this case, any sequence of elementary row operations that reduces $𝐴$ to $𝐼_𝑛$ also transforms $𝐼_𝑛$ into $𝐴^{−1}$

### Algorithm to find $A^{-1}$

-   Form augmented matrix $\begin{bmatrix}A~|~I\end{bmatrix}$.
-   Transform the augmented matrix to reduced row echelon form.
-   If $𝐴$ is row equivalent to $𝐼$, then $[𝐴 | 𝐼]$ is row equivalent to $[𝐼 | 𝐴^{−1}]$. Otherwise $𝐴$ does not have an inverse.
