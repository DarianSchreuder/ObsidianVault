Functions of two variables are functions that take two input values and produce one output. They can be represented by an equation in the form $f(x,y) = z$, where $z$ is the output and $x$ and $y$ are the input values. In calculus, one important tool for analyzing these functions is the partial derivative, which measures the rate at which the function changes with respect to each input variable separately.

### Definition

A `function `$f$` of two variables` is a rule that assigns to each ordered pair of real numbers $(x,y)$ in a set $D$ a unique real number denoted by $f(x,y)$.The set D is the `domain` of $f$ and its `range` is the set of values that $f$ takes on, that is, $\{ f(x,y)\ |\ (x,y) \in D\}$.

We often write $z = f (x, y)$ to make explicit the value taken on by $f$ at the general point $(x, y)$. The variables $x$ and $y$ are `independent variables` and $z$ is the `dependent variable`.

### Graphs

### Definition

If $f$ is a function of two variables with domain $D$, then the `graph` of $f$ is the set of all points $(x,y,z)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ such that $z=f(x,y)$ and $(x,y)$ is in $D$.

### Level Curves and Contour Maps

### Definition

The `level curves` of a function $f$ of two variables are the curves with equations $f(x, y)=k$, where $k$ is a constant (in the range of $f$ ).

A level curve _$f(x, y) = k$_ is the set of all points in the domain of $f$ at which $f$ takes on a given value $k$. In other words, it is a curve in the $xy$-plane that shows where the graph of $f$ has height $k$ (above or below the $xy$-plane). A collection of level curves is called a contour map.

### Functions of three or more Variables

A function of three variables, $f$, is a rule that assigns to each ordered triple $(x, y, z)$ in a domain $D \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ a unique real number denoted by $f(x, y, z)$.

Functions of any number of variables can be considered. A function of $n$ variables is a rule that assigns a number $z = f(x_l, x_2, ... , x_n)$ to an n-tuple $(x_l, x_2, ... , x_n)$ of real numbers. We denote by $\mathbb{R}^n$ the set of all such n-tuples. For example, if a company uses $n$ different ingredients in making a food product, $C_i$ is the cost per unit of the ith ingredient, and units of the ith ingredient are used, then the total cost $C$ of the ingredients is a function of the n variables $x_1, x_2, ... , x_n$:

$$ C = f(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)=c_1x_1+c_2x_2+...+c_nx_n $$

The function $f$ is a real-valued function whose domain is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Sometimes we use vector notation to write such functions more compactly: If $\vec x = \langle x_1, x_2, . . . , x_n \rangle$, we often write $f(x)$ in place of $f(x_1, x_2, . . . , x_n )$. With this notation we can rewrite the function defined in Equation 3 as

$$ f(\vec x)=c\cdot x $$

where $\vec c = \langle c_1, c_2, . . . , c_n \rangle$ and $\vec c \cdot \vec x$ denotes the dot product of the vectors $\vec c$ and $\vec x$ in $V_n.$ In view of the one-to-one correspondence between points $(x_1, x_2, . . . , x_n)$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and their position vectors $\vec x = \langle x_1, x_2, . . . , x_n \rangle$ in $V_n$, we have three ways of looking at a function $f$ defined on a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$:

1.  As a function of n real variables $x_1, x_2, . . . , x_n$
2.  As a function of a single point variable $(x_1, x_2, . . . , x_n )$
3.  As a function of a single vector variable $\vec x = \langle x_1, x_2, . . . , x_n \rangle$
