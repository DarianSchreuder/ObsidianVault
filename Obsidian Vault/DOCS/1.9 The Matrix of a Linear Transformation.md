The matrix of a linear transformation is a matrix that represents the transformation. Given a linear transformation $T: R^n \rightarrow R^m$, we can represent it as a matrix $A$ with $m$ rows and $n$ columns. The columns of $A$ are the images of the basis vectors of $\mathbb{R}^n$ under $T$. In other words, if $\vec e_1,\vec e_2,\dots,\vec e_n$ is the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^n$, then the columns of $A$ are $T(\vec e_1), T(\vec e_2),\dots, T(\vec e_n)$.

To apply the transformation $T$ to a vector $\vec x$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, we simply multiply $A$ by $\vec x$, i.e., $T(\vec x) = A\vec x$. Conversely, given a matrix $A$, we can define a linear transformation $T$ by $T(\vec x) = A\vec x$.

The matrix of a linear transformation is useful because it allows us to perform operations on the transformation algebraically, using matrix multiplication and other linear algebra techniques. It also allows us to easily compose and invert linear transformations.

### Theorem 10

Let 𝑇: $ℝ^𝑛$ → $ℝ^m$ be a linear transformation. Then there exists a unique matrix $𝐴$ such that:

$T(\vec x) = A\vec x \hspace{1 cm}$ for all $\vec x \in \mathbb{R}^n$

In Fact

$$ A = [T(\vec e_{1}) ... T(\vec e_{n})], $$

where $e_{j}$ is the _`j-th`_ column vector of the identity matrix.

### Definition

A mapping $𝑇: ℝ^𝑛 → ℝ^𝑚$ is said to be `“onto”` $ℝ^𝑚$ if each $\vec b$ in $ℝ^𝑚$ is the image of at least one $\vec x$ in$ℝ^𝑛$.

A mapping $𝑇: ℝ^𝑛 → \mathbb{R}^m$ is said to be `“one-to- one”` if each $\vec b$ in $ℝ^𝑚$ is the image of at most one $\vec x$ in $ℝ^𝑛$.

$$ T(\vec u) = T(\vec v)\rightarrow \vec u = \vec v \ \forall \ \vec u,\vec v \in \mathbb{R}^n $$

### Theorem 11

Let $\ T:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ be a linear transformation.

Then $T$ is `one-to-one` if and only if the equation $T(\vec x) = \vec 0$ has only the trivial solution.

_**Proof:**_

$(\Leftarrow)$: Suppose $T(\vec x) = \vec 0$ has only the trivial solution and $T(\vec u) = T(\vec v)$ for vectors $u,v \in \mathbb{R}^n$

Since $T$ is linear, $\vec 0 = T(\vec u) -T(\vec v) = T(\vec u-\vec v)$, hence $\vec u-\vec v$ is a solution of $T(\vec x) = \vec 0$ and so $\vec u-\vec v = \vec 0$, $i.e \ \vec u = \vec v$

Thus $T$ is `one-to-one`.

$(\rightarrow):$ Let $T$ be `one-to-one`.

Since $T$ is a linear transformation, we know that if $\vec v \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is any solution of $T(\vec x) = \vec 0$ then $T(\vec v)=\vec 0=T(\vec 0)$ and since $T$ is `one-to-one`, we have

Therefore is the only solution.

### Theorem 12

Let $𝑇: ℝ^𝑛 → ℝ^𝑚$ be a linear transformation and let $𝐴$ be the standard matrix for $T$. Then

-   $T$ maps $ℝ^𝑛$ `onto` $ℝ^𝑚$ if and only if the columns of $A$ span $ℝ^𝑚$ .
-   $T$ is `one-to-one` if and only if the columns of $A$ are `linearly independent`.

### Theorem 12’

Let $𝑇: ℝ^𝑛 → ℝ^𝑚$ be a linear transformation and let $𝐴$ be the standard matrix for $T$. Then

-   $T$ maps $ℝ^𝑛$ `onto` $ℝ^𝑚$ if and only if $A$ has a pivot point in each row.
-   $T$ is `one-to-one` if and only if $A$ has a pivot point in each column.
