### Definition
An indexed set of vectors $\{𝒗_1,𝒗_2,\dots, 𝒗_𝑝\}$ in $ℝ^𝑛$ is said to be `linearly independent` if the vector equation $$𝑥_1\vec 𝒗_1 + 𝑥_2\vec 𝒗_2 +\dots+ 𝑥_𝑝\vec 𝒗_𝑝 = \vec 0$$ has only the trivial solution.

An indexed set of vectors $\{𝒗_1,𝒗_2,\dots, 𝒗_𝑝\}$ in $ℝ^𝑛$ is said to be `linearly dependent` if there exist weights $𝑐_1, 𝑐_2,\dots,𝑐_𝑝$ , not all zero $$𝑐_1\vec 𝒗_1 + 𝑐_2\vec 𝒗_2 +\dots + 𝑐_𝑝\vec 𝒗_𝑝 = \vec 0$$
### Linear Independence of Matrix Columns

The columns of a matrix 𝐴 is `linearly independent` if and only if the equation $𝐴\vec 𝒙 = \vec 0$ has only the trivial solution.

### Set of 2 vectors

A set of two vectors is `linearly dependent` if and only if at least one of the vectors is a multiple of the other.

### Sets of Two or More Vectors
**Theorem 7**
An indexed set $S = \{𝒗_1,𝒗_2,\dots, 𝒗_𝑝\}$

of two or more vectors is linearly dependent if and only if at least one of the vectors in $𝑆$ is a linear combination of the other.
In fact, if 𝑆 is `linearly dependent` and $\vec v_1 ≠ \vec 0$, then some $\vec 𝒗_𝑗$ (with 𝑗 > 1) is a linear combination of the preceding vectors $\vec 𝒗_𝟏,\dots,\vec 𝒗_{𝑗−1}$ .

**Theorem 8**
If a set contains more vectors than there are entries in each vector, then the set is linearly dependent. That is, any set $\{𝒗_1,𝒗_2,\dots, 𝒗_𝑝\}$ in $ℝ^𝑛$ is linearly dependent if $𝑝 > 𝑛$.

**Theorem 9**
If a set $\{𝒗_1,𝒗_2,\dots, 𝒗_𝑝\}$ in $ℝ^𝑛$ contains the zero vector, then the set is `linearly dependent`.
