1. Explain artificial intelligence, including its various definitions and dimensions, such as human versus rational and thought versus behaviour perspectives. 
    What is AI?
     Historically there are several different versions of AI. Some define intelligence in terms of fidelity to human preformance, while others prefer a more abstract, formal definition of intelligence called rationality (loosely speaking, doing the "right thing"). 

     Two dimensions being human versus rational and thought versus behaviour, There are four possible combinations.
     The Turing test, proposed by Alan Turing (1950), was designed as a thought experiment that would remove philosophical vagueness of the question "Can a computer think?". The computer passes if an investigator cannot tell if a response is computer written or human. The computer would need the following capabilities:
     1. natural language processing to communicate in  a human language.

     2. knowledge representation to store wat it knows or hears.

     3. automated reasoning to answer questions and to draw new conclusions

     4. machine learning to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns.

1. Distinguish between AI approaches that aim to replicate human intelligence and those that focus on rationality, which involves doing the “right thing” based on logical decision-making. 

2. Understand the breadth of AI, recognizing its subfields and the diverse tasks it encompasses, from playing chess to diagnosing diseases. Also, understand the challenges in creating machines that can perform effectively in novel situations. 

3. Learn about the historical connection between philosophy and AI, including the influence of Aristotle’s syllogisms and Ramon Llull’s reasoning systems on developing logical thinking in AI. 

4. Explore how mathematical principles, particularly formal logic and computation, form the foundation for AI, recognizing contributions from figures like Boole, Frege, and Turing. 

5. Discuss how AI evolved from philosophical questioning (e.g., can formal rules draw valid conclusions?) to applying mathematical logic and the concept of computation. 

6. Understand how AI integrates ideas from philosophy and mathematics, leading to the development of a formal science that combines logical reasoning with computational processes.
